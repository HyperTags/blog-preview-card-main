## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to position a child element in a parent element using grid.

The syntax used is as below:

```css
.parent-element {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
```

I also discovered that the place-items gives align-items and justify-content a default value of center.

### Continued development

Even though I can find my way around flexbox and grid, I seek to learning more and perfecting myself in them. I also seek to perfect myself in using media queries and box shadow.

### Useful resources

- [Colors and Shadows - Devslopes](https://youtu.be/EMJYCGaaIUo?si=XKVh2jakuS_qlHdA) - This helped me understand the possible values that can be given to the box shadow style and what they mean. It was really helpful.
